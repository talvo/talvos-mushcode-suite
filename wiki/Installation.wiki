Installing Talvo's MUSHcode Suite is very simple.

First, you need to make a new wizard character. This character will own everything in the Suite. ALWAYS use this character to make changes to the Suite. NEVER use this character for anything else.

  # Login as God (#1), and run the following commands:
    # @pcreate !CoreWiz=coolpassword
    # @set `*`!CoreWiz=WIZARD
    # @power `*`!CoreWiz=NO_PAY
  # Logout of God and connect to your newly-made !CoreWiz. DO NOT INSTALL THE CODE AS GOD.
    # Download the [http://talvos-mushcode-suite.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/suite-core Core] and install by copying and pasting into your MUSH. This is the code which powers the Suite. 
    # Download and install (by copy/pasting to your MUSH) any of the [Modules] you want to use. They're all optional - you can pick the ones you want and skip the rest.
      * Note that some modules may tell you to run an additional command as God to complete the installation.
  # @shutdown/reboot
  # That's it - the core is now installed and should be working. Check the helpfiles for the modules you've installed to see how to customize them for your game.
